# qsim-experimental-control
During my PhD at the University of Sydney, Quantum Contorl Lab, I built a challenging atomic physics experiment, now one of three in the world, including a working Penning trap, custom UV laser system & experimental control software (Python based), supporting quantum simulation research with hundreds of spin qubits. 

This repository contains the experimental control software I wrote for automating control of this experimental system. 

More information about this system experiment can be found in my PhD thesis:
